Working with two other co-founders, we built the web app which allowed language students from around the world to practice through face-to-face video chats (before anyone had heard of Zoom!)\n+\n+![Screenshot of Versify web app with two people having a video chat](/versify-old-ui-video-chat.png \"A Versify online language exchange\")\n+\n+\n+From a solid base of running a successful student organisation, the Language Exchange Society, which operated in various London universities including King's College London, UCL and SOAS, I could see that there was a demand for this type of learning. The issue for some students was finding people who spoke the languages they wanted to learn or at times convenient for them. Although we had over 3,000 members, I could see that we needed to expand further to allow for the full benefits of the network effects. \n+\n+I had the idea to create an online language exchange, to break down the geographic barriers we had by being confined to London universities, and received funding from King's College London to make a start on this, but realistically it was only enough to build an upgraded website which allowed easier scheduling of in-person sessions. We needed a video element as well. \n+\n+Luckily there was another person in London working on a similar problem who was able also help fund it, and we joined forces! We launched a web app that was used by members from every continent, with the strongest base of users in the UK, Japan, France and Spain. \n+\n+Working with the two other co-founders on the business, I was particularly involved in planning the product roadmap and working through this with the technical co-founder. This included building prototypes and iterating them based on user testing and feedback, and using this information to create the product roadmap. We were successful applicants to the Google/Techstars Startup Next accelerator programme, but ultimately couldn't achieve product-market fit or decide on a viable business model. \n+\n+It was a great experience to work on my own business as my first proper digital project, and was the springboard for future digital projects. \n+\n+## The project\n+\n+As a French speaker and someone who has previously taught English abroad, I know the key thing holding people back from achieving fluency in languages is the lack of time spent speaking the language with natives. This usually requires you to spend extended periods of time in a country where the language is spoken, which is often not logistically or financially possible for most language learners. \n+\n+There were plenty of fantastic apps like Duolingo helping learners with their vocabulary and grammar, but there was nothing to help with the stepping stone to fluency – practical speaking experience.\n+\n+I had two year’s experience working on the Language Exchange Society project, but in October 2014 had a limited budget to take the project beyond the “pre-MVP” website. \n+\n+I started working with another founder, Kenzo, who was working on a similar project and had a budget to dedicate. As the person funding the business, Kenzo became managing director and I focused on product development and marketing, given my experience of marketing to students and growing the project in London universities.\n+\n+##Bringing on a technical co-founder\n+\n+As we started working together, Kenzo had already hired a freelance developer and began building the early web app. There was still a lot of work to do to build and test the MVP and unfortunately the freelancer’s limited experience meant that features took longer to develop than we hoped, and bug fixes then delayed things longer. \n+\n+Despite the development issues, and about a month behind schedule, we launched a minimum viable product (MVP) of the app. It had all of the basic features we needed — \u001fmember sign up, inbox/instant messaging, video chats and our distinguishing credits system. The design wasn’t great and after the launch the developer was occupied totally by fixing bugs rather than developing new features, but we had a “product” that was “minimum” and “viable.” Members could use the system perfectly well to connect with others from around the world and practice languages.\n+\n+Unfortunately the user experience improvements that we wanted to make were beyond the freelancer’s abilities, and most of his time was spent fixing bugs. Without a clear roadmap, project stages or acceptance criteria, we were treading water. Kenzo and I agreed that we needed to find more experienced technical input. Looking for an alternative, we came across <a href=\"https://cofounderslab.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Co-founders Lab</a> and found an experienced technical co-founder called Rick who bought into our vision for the business, and was happy to receive equity rather than a salary for his efforts. This meant that we not only had a much more experienced developer, but also someone who was more motivated and crucially one who allowed us to spend our resources on growth rather than expensive development.\n+\n+With Rick we now felt we had a solid team of three: Rick is a great developer and had the most startup experience, Kenzo had a passion for the idea and is a very thoughtful and analytical leader, and I had experience of working with our core market and developing experience of product management. We outsourced some other tasks such as user interface (UI) design, social media content creation and translation (into French, Spanish and Japanese). \n+\n+Since the app built by the freelancer was not scalable, Rick suggested the only way forward was a re-platforming (i.e. starting from scratch and using different technology — in our case this was a switch from the freelancer’s Node.JS app to Rick’s preferred Ruby on Rails). \n+\n+As well as over 20 years technical experience, Rick also contributed valuable ideas on product planning, so based on his suggestions, I took a cluttered and disorganised Trello board, and turned it into a clear product roadmap in Pivotal Tracker, with manageable and prioritised user stories. \n+\n+We worked together in one-week sprints (deciding that two-week sprints trailed off towards the end), and as Rick built the foundation of the Ruby on Rails web app, I tested user flows and possible features with users, adjusting the roadmap based on the user research. This was mainly done by creating wireframes in Sketch and stitching them together to create clickable prototypes in InVision like <a href=\"https://goo.gl/iKZEKN\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>, sending it to the user, and having a Google Hangout screen share session to see how they interacted with the prototype. I fed this back in to the roadmap and prioritised user stories for the following week.\n+\n+![Versify user interface](/versify-new-ui.jpg \"Versify user interface\")\n+\n+While user testing with members using the MVP, I noticed an issue where people would arrange a video chat for a certain time, but then one or both members wouldn’t show up. I knew there was an issue with expecting strangers to trust each other and keep to their commitment, and I looked into ways of improving this. One suggestion was to either suggest members spend a bit more time using our instant messaging/inbox feature, to build up more familiarity and trust before arranging a video chat, or to jump straight into a chat with someone already online, so later scheduling and commitment wasn't neccessary. \n+\n+The MVP — although it has a crude user interface and some performance issues — had most of the features from my overall product vision: a sign up process, member profiles, a messaging and scheduling function, and credit-based video language exchange. One thing I thought was missing was a paid tuition feature. \n+\n+As well as being my overall plan for monetisation, I thought that a freelance tuition model would largely solve the commitment issue. The idea was that tutors could offer to teach other members for an hourly rate and that more experienced tutors would be able to command a higher price. Although we would keep the free language exchange for those who were interested in volunteering their time, for those who didn’t want to help other people they could pay cash rather than using the free credits system. \n+\n+This could solve our monetisation issue, as our free exchange needed a way to make money. It would avoid the issue of needing a perfect balance of learning/teaching required from the free exchange. And it would in theory also make people more committed - less than 5% of people who sign up for free online courses finish them, but the number increases massively when some money is involved. \n+\n+This would also replicate the already successful in-person tutoring market, where tutors work freelance and are able to charge an hourly rate based on their experience and reputation. It would have the added benefit of allowing language tutors from around the world to expand out of their physical location, and reach a much larger online market. This trend of freelance marketplaces was also supported by the rise of services such as Uber and Elance. \n+\n+In terms of our business model, we would charge a commission for freelancers earning money on the site in return for us providing students and a system where they are guaranteed to get paid the right amount (based on their rate and the length of time taught). Membership would be free for learners and tutors, and we could consider offering premium membership for tutors to help them differentiate from less experienced tutors.\n+\n+Discussing this with the other co-founders restarted the discussion of overall vision and business model for the future. Kenzo had a different vision to me regarding monetisation of the project — his initial idea was that the language exchange should be free and thought that a paid tutor system would disrupt this core principle. Rather than have a paid tutor service, he wanted to monetise paid premium content. Unlike the freelance model, I thought this would take us outside of our area of expertise — none of us had experience creating content such as language games or lessons, and any interactive elements would add more strain to the amount of development work needed. We agreed to disagree for a time, but as a key aspect of any company’s success, we should have tested the options and decided on the best way forward earlier to avoid ambiguity. \n+\n+As one of the perils of innovative projects, we were also struggling to find product-market fit. People were interested in what we were doing, thought it was a good idea and we could get people to sign up. We had no shortage of people (especially language students) who thought the idea was really useful and had great potential. However, getting people to connect with strangers and trust each other enough to commit to regular language exchanges was unfortunately a step too far. It seemed we had taken the free exchange as far as we could.\n+\n+I thought that the paid freelancer model would change the way we could market ourselves, as rather than a totally voluntary system, we would be able to market to tutors as a way for them to make additional income. At the same time, we would be able to market to learners as having high quality, committed tutors available around the clock. \n+\n+Concerned with the struggle to find product-market fit, Kenzo was also not convinced about our business model options, and decided to step away from the project and withdraw funding. Rick was still working on the job of re-platforming an imperfect system, and there was plenty of work left to do. With the team changing and losing funding, Rick stepped down as well.\n+\n+With the main sources of funding and development experience leaving the project, I knew that it was going to be too great of a dip for me to get the project back on track. With Kenzo and Rick on board I thought we had a good chance to make the project financially viable, but without them I would have had to spend all of my time filling the gap rather than progressing the aim of the project. \n+\n+Before starting the project, I had read Seth Godin’s \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dip-extraordinary-benefits-knowing-stick/dp/0749928301\" target=\"_blank\">The Dip</a>,\" which talks about defining the amount of time and money that you are willing to dedicate to a project, and making this decision at the beginning of the project. The idea being that once the decision has been made, you don’t quit while things are getting difficult, but you also don’t invest more than your previous (less emotional/biased) self has decided. Later on in the project, you need to see the time and money you've decided to commit as a sunk cost, and avoid the temptation to do stop too soon or do “just a little bit more” because of how far you’ve come and how near it seems to working out.\n+\n+It's an exercise me and Kenzo did at the beginning of the project. Starting the project as a student, then working on it full-time and latterly working on it alongside another project manager role, I didn’t have the ability to fund the project myself, so the amount that I agreed with myself was £0. Starting with Kenzo in October 2014 I also agreed with myself that I would spend two years working on it, and if it wasn’t financially viable by October 2016 and able to pay me a living salary, I would walk away. \n+\n+Kenzo and Rick left in spring 2016. I attempted to continue during the summer. By late summer it was obvious that my goal was unachievable and I closed down the project in October 2016.\n+\n+Working on the project was a fantastic experience and I learned a lot about the hard work (and luck) that you need to make an innovative business like Versify work. It also reinforced my opinion that digital projects can scale beyond geographic boundaries\n+\n+Although it was difficult to walk away from a project I had worked on for more than four years (first as the student society then as the startup company), I was glad to have gained experience of working with some great people, and it started my career in digital technology. \n\\ No newline at end of file"

Working with two other co-founders, we built the web app which allowed language students from around the world to practice through face-to-face video chats (before anyone had heard of Zoom!)\n+\n+![Screenshot of Versify web app with two people having a video chat](/versify-old-ui-video-chat.png \"A Versify online language exchange\")\n+\n+\n+From a solid base of running a successful student organisation, the Language Exchange Society, which operated in various London universities including King's College London, UCL and SOAS, I could see that there was a demand for this type of learning. The issue for some students was finding people who spoke the languages they wanted to learn or at times convenient for them. Although we had over 3,000 members, I could see that we needed to expand further to allow for the full benefits of the network effects. \n+\n+I had the idea to create an online language exchange, to break down the geographic barriers we had by being confined to London universities, and received funding from King's College London to make a start on this, but realistically it was only enough to build an upgraded website which allowed easier scheduling of in-person sessions. We needed a video element as well. \n+\n+Luckily there was another person in London working on a similar problem who was able also help fund it, and we joined forces! We launched a web app that was used by members from every continent, with the strongest base of users in the UK, Japan, France and Spain. \n+\n+Working with the two other co-founders on the business, I was particularly involved in planning the product roadmap and working through this with the technical co-founder. This included building prototypes and iterating them based on user testing and feedback, and using this information to create the product roadmap. We were successful applicants to the Google/Techstars Startup Next accelerator programme, but ultimately couldn't achieve product-market fit or decide on a viable business model. \n+\n+It was a great experience to work on my own business as my first proper digital project, and was the springboard for future digital projects. \n+\n+## The project\n+\n+As a French speaker and someone who has previously taught English abroad, I know the key thing holding people back from achieving fluency in languages is the lack of time spent speaking the language with natives. This usually requires you to spend extended periods of time in a country where the language is spoken, which is often not logistically or financially possible for most language learners. \n+\n+There were plenty of fantastic apps like Duolingo helping learners with their vocabulary and grammar, but there was nothing to help with the stepping stone to fluency – practical speaking experience.\n+\n+I had two year’s experience working on the Language Exchange Society project, but in October 2014 had a limited budget to take the project beyond the “pre-MVP” website. \n+\n+I started working with another founder, Kenzo, who was working on a similar project and had a budget to dedicate. As the person funding the business, Kenzo became managing director and I focused on product development and marketing, given my experience of marketing to students and growing the project in London universities.\n+\n+##Bringing on a technical co-founder\n+\n+As we started working together, Kenzo had already hired a freelance developer and began building the early web app. There was still a lot of work to do to build and test the MVP and unfortunately the freelancer’s limited experience meant that features took longer to develop than we hoped, and bug fixes then delayed things longer. \n+\n+Despite the development issues, and about a month behind schedule, we launched a minimum viable product (MVP) of the app. It had all of the basic features we needed — \u001fmember sign up, inbox/instant messaging, video chats and our distinguishing credits system. The design wasn’t great and after the launch the developer was occupied totally by fixing bugs rather than developing new features, but we had a “product” that was “minimum” and “viable.” Members could use the system perfectly well to connect with others from around the world and practice languages.\n+\n+Unfortunately the user experience improvements that we wanted to make were beyond the freelancer’s abilities, and most of his time was spent fixing bugs. Without a clear roadmap, project stages or acceptance criteria, we were treading water. Kenzo and I agreed that we needed to find more experienced technical input. Looking for an alternative, we came across <a href=\"https://cofounderslab.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Co-founders Lab</a> and found an experienced technical co-founder called Rick who bought into our vision for the business, and was happy to receive equity rather than a salary for his efforts. This meant that we not only had a much more experienced developer, but also someone who was more motivated and crucially one who allowed us to spend our resources on growth rather than expensive development.\n+\n+With Rick we now felt we had a solid team of three: Rick is a great developer and had the most startup experience, Kenzo had a passion for the idea and is a very thoughtful and analytical leader, and I had experience of working with our core market and developing experience of product management. We outsourced some other tasks such as user interface (UI) design, social media content creation and translation (into French, Spanish and Japanese). \n+\n+Since the app built by the freelancer was not scalable, Rick suggested the only way forward was a re-platforming (i.e. starting from scratch and using different technology — in our case this was a switch from the freelancer’s Node.JS app to Rick’s preferred Ruby on Rails). \n+\n+As well as over 20 years technical experience, Rick also contributed valuable ideas on product planning, so based on his suggestions, I took a cluttered and disorganised Trello board, and turned it into a clear product roadmap in Pivotal Tracker, with manageable and prioritised user stories. \n+\n+We worked together in one-week sprints (deciding that two-week sprints trailed off towards the end), and as Rick built the foundation of the Ruby on Rails web app, I tested user flows and possible features with users, adjusting the roadmap based on the user research. This was mainly done by creating wireframes in Sketch and stitching them together to create clickable prototypes in InVision like <a href=\"https://goo.gl/iKZEKN\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>, sending it to the user, and having a Google Hangout screen share session to see how they interacted with the prototype. I fed this back in to the roadmap and prioritised user stories for the following week.\n+\n+![Versify user interface](/versify-new-ui.jpg \"Versify user interface\")\n+\n+While user testing with members using the MVP, I noticed an issue where people would arrange a video chat for a certain time, but then one or both members wouldn’t show up. I knew there was an issue with expecting strangers to trust each other and keep to their commitment, and I looked into ways of improving this. One suggestion was to either suggest members spend a bit more time using our instant messaging/inbox feature, to build up more familiarity and trust before arranging a video chat, or to jump straight into a chat with someone already online, so later scheduling and commitment wasn't neccessary. \n+\n+The MVP — although it has a crude user interface and some performance issues — had most of the features from my overall product vision: a sign up process, member profiles, a messaging and scheduling function, and credit-based video language exchange. One thing I thought was missing was a paid tuition feature. \n+\n+As well as being my overall plan for monetisation, I thought that a freelance tuition model would largely solve the commitment issue. The idea was that tutors could offer to teach other members for an hourly rate and that more experienced tutors would be able to command a higher price. Although we would keep the free language exchange for those who were interested in volunteering their time, for those who didn’t want to help other people they could pay cash rather than using the free credits system. \n+\n+This could solve our monetisation issue, as our free exchange needed a way to make money. It would avoid the issue of needing a perfect balance of learning/teaching required from the free exchange. And it would in theory also make people more committed - less than 5% of people who sign up for free online courses finish them, but the number increases massively when some money is involved. \n+\n+This would also replicate the already successful in-person tutoring market, where tutors work freelance and are able to charge an hourly rate based on their experience and reputation. It would have the added benefit of allowing language tutors from around the world to expand out of their physical location, and reach a much larger online market. This trend of freelance marketplaces was also supported by the rise of services such as Uber and Elance. \n+\n+In terms of our business model, we would charge a commission for freelancers earning money on the site in return for us providing students and a system where they are guaranteed to get paid the right amount (based on their rate and the length of time taught). Membership would be free for learners and tutors, and we could consider offering premium membership for tutors to help them differentiate from less experienced tutors.\n+\n+Discussing this with the other co-founders restarted the discussion of overall vision and business model for the future. Kenzo had a different vision to me regarding monetisation of the project — his initial idea was that the language exchange should be free and thought that a paid tutor system would disrupt this core principle. Rather than have a paid tutor service, he wanted to monetise paid premium content. Unlike the freelance model, I thought this would take us outside of our area of expertise — none of us had experience creating content such as language games or lessons, and any interactive elements would add more strain to the amount of development work needed. We agreed to disagree for a time, but as a key aspect of any company’s success, we should have tested the options and decided on the best way forward earlier to avoid ambiguity. \n+\n+As one of the perils of innovative projects, we were also struggling to find product-market fit. People were interested in what we were doing, thought it was a good idea and we could get people to sign up. We had no shortage of people (especially language students) who thought the idea was really useful and had great potential. However, getting people to connect with strangers and trust each other enough to commit to regular language exchanges was unfortunately a step too far. It seemed we had taken the free exchange as far as we could.\n+\n+I thought that the paid freelancer model would change the way we could market ourselves, as rather than a totally voluntary system, we would be able to market to tutors as a way for them to make additional income. At the same time, we would be able to market to learners as having high quality, committed tutors available around the clock. \n+\n+Concerned with the struggle to find product-market fit, Kenzo was also not convinced about our business model options, and decided to step away from the project and withdraw funding. Rick was still working on the job of re-platforming an imperfect system, and there was plenty of work left to do. With the team changing and losing funding, Rick stepped down as well.\n+\n+With the main sources of funding and development experience leaving the project, I knew that it was going to be too great of a dip for me to get the project back on track. With Kenzo and Rick on board I thought we had a good chance to make the project financially viable, but without them I would have had to spend all of my time filling the gap rather than progressing the aim of the project. \n+\n+Before starting the project, I had read Seth Godin’s \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dip-extraordinary-benefits-knowing-stick/dp/0749928301\" target=\"_blank\">The Dip</a>,\" which talks about defining the amount of time and money that you are willing to dedicate to a project, and making this decision at the beginning of the project. The idea being that once the decision has been made, you don’t quit while things are getting difficult, but you also don’t invest more than your previous (less emotional/biased) self has decided. Later on in the project, you need to see the time and money you've decided to commit as a sunk cost, and avoid the temptation to do stop too soon or do “just a little bit more” because of how far you’ve come and how near it seems to working out.\n+\n+It's an exercise me and Kenzo did at the beginning of the project. Starting the project as a student, then working on it full-time and latterly working on it alongside another project manager role, I didn’t have the ability to fund the project myself, so the amount that I agreed with myself was £0. Starting with Kenzo in October 2014 I also agreed with myself that I would spend two years working on it, and if it wasn’t financially viable by October 2016 and able to pay me a living salary, I would walk away. \n+\n+Kenzo and Rick left in spring 2016. I attempted to continue during the summer. By late summer it was obvious that my goal was unachievable and I closed down the project in October 2016.\n+\n+Working on the project was a fantastic experience and I learned a lot about the hard work (and luck) that you need to make an innovative business like Versify work. It also reinforced my opinion that digital projects can scale beyond geographic boundaries\n+\n+Although it was difficult to walk away from a project I had worked on for more than four years (first as the student society then as the startup company), I was glad to have gained experience of working with some great people, and it started my career in digital technology. \n\\ No newline at end of file"
